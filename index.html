  <p>Are you a student looking to sell textbooks? Perhaps you’ve recently graduated from university, left school or simply have a pile of textbooks that are surplus to requirements. Whatever your reasons EdinburghBookExchange is a simple and hassle free way to sell textbooks for some much needed extra cash to put towards freshers week, rent or this semester’s reading material.
Textbooks aren’t cheap and in most cases you’ll only need them for a limited period of time before you’re required to overhaul your studying material and invest in a new collection of books.</p>
